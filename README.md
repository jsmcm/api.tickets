# Laravel Ticketing Back End
SmartTicket by SoftSmart.co.za is an opensource help desk/support ticket system. It supports multi-departments and users. It could be used within an organisation with multiple departments, or you could use it as a multi-company support ticket system if you provide IT services to various companies.

SmartTicket is an API first Laravel application. In order for it to work you'll need this backed as well as the nuxt frontend (or create your own front end).

It features canned replies too so you can easily and quickly answer those common questions.

Optionally connect to SmartTicket's AI service to automatically pick and answer questions from the canned replies list.
